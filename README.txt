This repo contains my first attempts at using html

Html scrapbook is just a collection of some of the typical elements I will be using when creating webpages, I tried to put most of what I have learnt on it so I can use it as a guide when I begin to make more complicated pages in the future. 

Index is just the first html document I have made and it was also used for testing git.
